            Spendt is a simple ReactJS project I made for my React study and exercise.
            It uses NextJS framework to optimise the build and makes thing faster and easier to develop.

            Originally, I wanted to make an iOS project for this. But since I wanted to improve my React skill,
            I decided to create this in React instead. A fun ride indeed!

            This proejct uses the basic react framework, and persist storage.
